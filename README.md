# tidy-islr

The Fall 2016 section of SDS293: Machine Learning at Smith College (taught by @jordancrouser) used a lightly-modified version of the base R labs from [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). These labs utilize much of the same code as the original versions/ but were broken into smaller thematic chunks in order to support more frequent mini-labs rather than a single weekly laboratory section. For clarity, they are included in this repository as Jupyter Notebooks.

The purpose of this ongoing project is to re-implement these exercises utilizing [tidyverse](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse) packages. We believe that this will make them accessible to a broader audience, and better facilitate the teaching of statistical learning methods in data science prorgrams.
